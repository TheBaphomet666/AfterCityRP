Today I've decided to release my samp gamemode as I have no intention of starting my server (I've lost most of my interest in SAMP). This gamemode has been sitting on my hard-drive for like half a year, in that time I haven't kept up with anything samp related soooo yeah, there may be a few issues. 

This is a unique script, but it is by no means finished, so whoever picks this up is going to need to do some work! I've made the repository public and so I guess (dependent on how generous I'm feeling) I will fix issues if you point them out on there! I don't think the script is too hard to understand, but IDK. Anyway, without further ado, Small County RP!

### Any Issues? ###
Just raise the issue on Github(https://github.com/donsta3000/Small-County-RP/issues) and I will look into it when I get the time.
